The table has several columns and rows, but I'll focus on the first column, which contains the type of patients. Here's a transcription of the table:\n\n| Type | Number of Patients |\n|------|---------------------|\n| Nondrinkers | 2,015             |\n| Drinkers | 1,999             |\n| Total  | 4,014             |\n\nThe table shows that there are 2,015 patients who do not drink alcohol, 1,999 patients who do drink alcohol, and a total of 4,014 patients in the hospital.\n\nTo answer your question, the number of patients who do not drink alcohol is 2,015. This information can be useful for understanding the prevalence of non-drinking patients in the hospital and for making informed decisions about patient care and resource allocation.",
